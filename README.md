# Homework 3
This homework assignment will be entirely related to linear regression and its implementation. So let's break our homework into several parts:

- write a linear regression hypothesis function in vector form;
- create a function to calculate the loss function in vector form;
- implement one step of gradient descent;
- find the best parameters w for the dataset to predict the price of a house depending on the area, number of bathrooms, and number of bedrooms;
- find the same parameters using an analytical solution;
- compare the results.

The assignment should be done in Jupyter Notebook (or Google Colab) and uploaded to Github as an .ipynb file.
